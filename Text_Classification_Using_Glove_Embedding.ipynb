I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tMusic\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see what else it can do.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t31-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI think this is the 5th one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'m working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tlooks great\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Love it!

Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it\\'s been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tOak Finish \\t\"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Love, Love, Love!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tOak Finish \\tJust what I expected....\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I love it, wife hates it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tReally happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it\\'s just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what\\'s not to like? :)\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We\\'re sure we\\'ll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it\\'s a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn\\'t understand what we\\'re saying.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not intrusive to look at.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tAmazing product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo. It\\'s easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised.

Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many \\xe2\\x80\\x9capps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun.

I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It\\'s fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I\\'ve been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it - am using it strictly for music now and it\\'s great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love the Echo !!!

I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her.

My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI don\\'t think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn\\'t you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn\\'t unique to this unit but I don\\'t understand why I can\\'t override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.

Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond or says she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Like everything about it.

Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can\\'t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\'t come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn\\'t missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It\\'s not a BOSE but it\\'s more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can\\'t wait to get for my classroom too! It\\'s a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\'s wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don\\'t hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn\\'t play anything. She isn\\'t smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can\\'t use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her.

Worth every penny. It\\'s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tListen music and set timer\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tI received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tGood sound.

The jokes are cute!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tPurchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tFunny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don\\'t consider it an upgrade.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not exactly tech smart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it mostly for music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSimply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I\\'m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEnjoyed entire echo experience\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEasy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn\\'t.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe are loving Ours very much\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best.

If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"\"smart home\"\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tEasy to setup.

If it had better built in speaker\\'s, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo.

Finally Amazon enables the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop-in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It\\'s not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack\\tLove it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo.

It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can\\'t complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source.

I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn\\'t sometimes I have to reset it I don\\'t know if it\\'s because it\\'s refurbished but it\\'s okay it\\'s just not what I expected\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tIt arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tLove my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn\\'t done and has already taken weeks.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI\\'ve already returned it.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful.

It\\'s been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorks amazingly.

The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one.

I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t14-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Took me awhile to get it connected.

Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t12-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire\\t1\\r\\n1\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tBought this for my son and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. He had to return it.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tBought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t12-Jun-18\\tBlack\\t\"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if this is the norm or if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Siri is that when she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey Siri\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to though \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alexa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of growing on me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tI bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorked like new.  Will do it again.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t11-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tThe second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t11-Jun-18\\tWhite\\t\"Very bad this device, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking.

Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn\\'t be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80\\'s music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box!

Now we just need Majel Barret\\'s voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It\\'s not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it\\'s still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome.

I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction\\t0\\r\\n5\\t2-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tWorks good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tTook a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jun-18\\tBlack\\tLove Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don\\'t know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to\\t1\\r\\n5\\t1-Jun-18\\tWhite\\tI loved it it works great\\t1\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tExtremely low in volume\\t0\\r\\n4\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don\\'t know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn\\'t have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn\\'t connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it\\'s just not as strong.\"\\t0\\r\\n1\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Purchased as a gift,\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorks great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she\\'s not listening when you don\\'t say the wake word so if you\\'re worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don\\'t hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tBlack\\tThe voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorked perfect\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tBlack\\tI bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren\\'t labeled as refurbished I wouldn\\'t have known\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tech savvy.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\tEh. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-May-18\\tWhite\\tGreat little thing. Works better than siri.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-May-18\\tBlack\\tIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tBought this for my son and he loves it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I\\'d still definitely recommend.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tVery fun to use and having morning briefing\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tArrived on time and works amazing!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"like new, good refurbishing\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove my echo dot!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tI like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn\\'t wireless and the volume is not that high.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tWhite\\tgreat product!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"It works great, but the reason I\\'m leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tI love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tEs perfecto.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorking good so far.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorking great and my daughter loves it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorks great\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-May-18\\tWhite\\tI love it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-May-18\\tWhite\\t\"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.

Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t24-May-18\\tBlack\\tHave had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected.

The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t22-May-18\\tWhite\\tBought this to go in my niece\\'s room. You can\\'t tell it\\'s refurbished. It looks good and works like new.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t21-May-18\\tWhite\\tDevice was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t21-May-18\\tBlack\\tSent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?\\t0\\r\\n5\\t20-May-18\\tWhite\\tBest price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-May-18\\tBlack\\tI have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-May-18\\tBlack\\tLove our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-May-18\\tBlack\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t19-May-18\\tBlack\\tIt has all I need for my life plans time date music\\t1\\r\\n3\\t19-May-18\\tBlack\\tSeems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xac and is much louder.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t19-May-18\\tWhite\\tLove it!  Works perfectly!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t19-May-18\\tWhite\\tI had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t19-May-18\\tBlack\\tI bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it\\xe2\\x80\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\t1\\r\\n4\\t18-May-18\\tBlack\\t\"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great.

My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it linked to my phone yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-May-18\\tWhite\\tWorks perfect!

I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see what else it can do.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t31-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI think this is the 5th one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'m working on getting one in every room of my house.

We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it\\'s just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what\\'s not to like? :)\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tLove the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We\\'re sure we\\'ll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it\\'s a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn\\'t understand what we\\'re saying.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not intrusive to look at.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.

Love them!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Fun item to play with and get used to using.

I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I\\'ve done it correctly but they won\\'t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThis device is awesome!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love my Echo.

Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\'s what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven\\'t had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with.

It works well. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many \\xe2\\x80\\x9capps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tThe speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI LIKE IT ALL\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI love it.

I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It\\'s fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I\\'ve been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it - am using it strictly for music now and it\\'s great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Love the Echo !!!

I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn\\'t rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be happier!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tIt\\'s Alexa.... what else can you say\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tUpgraded from my lilttle echo dot.

It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine.

I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.

It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdropping in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.on my son when he gets home.

I bought my Echo through QVC.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tit\\'s annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn\\'t be without an Echo.

BUT, I really love having the music.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tThis is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better.

Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let\\'s you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you\\'d like as there are more for sale.

It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to me, but will my husband.

Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can\\'t tell it even has one. works great. Didn\\'t come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn\\'t missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It\\'s not a BOSE but it\\'s more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can\\'t wait to get for my classroom too! It\\'s a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it\\'s wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don\\'t hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn\\'t play anything. She isn\\'t smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can\\'t use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I\\'ll ever use my Alexa again.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI like everything about it !!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLiked 100%\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tNever had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW.

Worth every penny. It\\'s like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tListen music and set timer\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tI received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tGood sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tPurchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\t\"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tFunny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don\\'t consider it an upgrade.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not exactly tech smart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using it mostly for music.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSimply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I\\'m too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEnjoyed entire echo experience\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tEasy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn\\'t.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tWe are loving Ours very much\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I\\'m happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.\\'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discovered.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"\"smart home\"\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tEasy to setup.

Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We\\'ve also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\t\"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tI have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tWe are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tCharcoal Fabric \\tSee subject line.  Love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\tVery easy setup.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tHeather Gray Fabric \\t\"I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn\\'t feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tSandstone Fabric \\tSound quality is great.

Very fun to learn how to use it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos\\t1\\r\\n4\\t31-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used as a clock and standard dot\\xe2\\x80\\x99ish features.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tAmazing so far. Just got it the other day.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I like that it\\'s smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great shape and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take up a lot of room. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEcho.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tHonestly I like it but at the same time I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Overall it\\'s great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn\\'t respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThe thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tWe absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThis is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove my Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt is very slow compared to the echo\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tNew to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It\\'s not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What\\'s not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it.  It is so easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tPut this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tVery easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love my new Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tCouldn\\'t be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tResponds easily and like the ability to do at night.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tEasy setup  Love it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSound quality is disappointing.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tGreat sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe ease to use product\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven\\'t figured it all out yet, but so far it\\'s pretty cool!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove my Echo Spot!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great deal, great product!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tPerfect\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc\\xe2\\x80\\x9di know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool now having an \\xe2\\x80\\x98appliance\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always just there, and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interrupt what i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy I have it! Would recommend!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt was a gift and the recipient love love loves it \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8b\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8b\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8b\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8b\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Cool little piece of tech...we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my \\xe2\\x80\\x98technically challenged\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can\\'t turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don\\'t need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don\\'t need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that\\'s not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that\\'s actually useful.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tSo far so good.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn\\'t always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don\\'t speak English anyways.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSmaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tEcho Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tNice\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI like it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"We\\'ve owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven\\'t found much use for them.  We just don\\'t find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you\\'re routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I like how small it is, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still able to see my Ring cameras.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat for checking in on my son after school when I\\'m still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish\\t0\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn\\'t work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn\\'t hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn\\'t as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who\\'s at the front door.  But, it\\'s great for the bedside.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFun tech toy\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it. Small with good sound\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this device! It\\'s so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it\\'s dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tHands free control\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I\\'ve added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it\\'s ridiculous that it can\\'t access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSetup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product!

I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connect to my Spotify unless it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premium and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in college and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not paying or that or amazon music so\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Spot to Spot. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn\\'t pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house).

The screen is a major plus.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don\\'t allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"It\\'s fun to use, and makes my life easier in some sense.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I\\'m still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this!

She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a convert. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 LOVE these and the dots.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very smart and sweet design\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tso far just ok\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not bright for sleeping.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it\\'s own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove this. So glad I purchased\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe Echo Spot is great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for prime day again to get one for my moms bedside table.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Fantastic product, absolutely love it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove these!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tstill learning how to ise it but is DOES NOT disappoint. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving to everyone for Christmas so I can \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccheck in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tVery helpful with daily activities\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tExactly as advertised\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tIts very nice\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"More than I expected.

I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tEasy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is great to be able to see him in between visits.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can\\'t change it.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tGreat size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love it and it works great, the only issue is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I don\\'t know why I like it, but I do. It\\'s like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It\\'s quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tQuick and easy to set up\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat device\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a fan of echo devices. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still learning different functions\\t1\\r\\n2\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tMeh\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tBest looking Echo device. Easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tA helpful product with a few glitches eg inability to occasionally access all flash briefing stations and understand or answer certain questions but Amazon will likely fix and improve it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\twe like it. very convenient\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThe amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tlove the spot\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tEasy to use easy to set up\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it\\'s an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGreat deal on prime day\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tno problem\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tExcelente su funcionamiento y llama la atenci\\xc3\\xb3n la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a trav\\xc3\\xa9s de la utilizaci\\xc3\\xb3n con Alexa.

Muy recomendable.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI love love it !\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can\\'t read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow\\'s alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don\\'t need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn\\'t appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThis product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. The screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tWorks well and was easy to set up.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tThis is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.

Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Wasn\\'t so sure about bringing &#34;smart technology&#34; into my home, but I\\'m hooked! I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync\\'d with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n1\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tYou need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It\\'s going back very soon!\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn\\'t answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn\\'t strong. Over all I haven\\'t had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn\\'t listen to those reviews.

Plus when I do get smart home devices she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be even more useful to me! She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really helpful with answering random questions.

After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch a movie I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been dying to see on this, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaws\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on this and while it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as bad as one would think.

Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven\\'t adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tExcellent\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tAwesome item that I had to buy two!\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment.

So great to use!!!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn\\'t impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"LOVE love love this!  I have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.

I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tYou\\'re going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don\\'t have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, \"\"I don\\'t know that skill\"\" even though I\\'ve added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tSuch a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I got this on Prime day and figured I\\'d see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn\\'t really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn\\'t get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990\\'s and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot\\'s screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it\\'s hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don\\'t know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I\\'d love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can\\'t the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it\\'s a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I\\'m already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can\\'t tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I LOOOOOOOVE this thing! :) Watching movies on it is a bit of a disaster because of the round screen, but other than that it\\'s a GREAT chachki toy :)\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWe gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.  She loves it.  She can play music of all genres!  Easy for her to use.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tVery easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in Hong Kong, but works fine now. I used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I\\'m very used to these devices. I don\\'t need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I\\'m not a child and I don\\'t need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn\\'t Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tThis product just looks adorable in any room and I love it.

I\\'ve been using for a couple months and if you\\'re an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I\\'m using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I\\'ve paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI like it as an Alexa device but its small.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tWhat a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can\\'t turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It \\'s an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don\\'t want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don\\'t want to see in the content rotation.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tCan\\'t turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll.

Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient!

I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how I lived without it so long. If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t regret it!!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFairly useless.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tBought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working\\xe2\\x80\\x94called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable\\xe2\\x80\\x94expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t17-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don\\'t add the stand as standard. I didn\\'t need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I\\'m not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I\\'m staying in a hotel and she\\'s no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I\\'m so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It\\'s so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tFor the size of the screen this thing should be $25\\t0\\r\\n3\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa set an alarm for 5am\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then having Alexa repeat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOK alarm set for 5am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in the shower.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tI bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t1\\r\\n1\\t17-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tInvasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF\\t0\\r\\n4\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I\\'m finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I\\'m not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it\\'s just the sound. Sometimes I\\'ll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I\\'m only 8 feet away plus it\\'s on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That\\'s one reason I bought the Echo Show.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrop in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself. And I feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to Alexa for help!!\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t \\t0\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re considering purchasing one, get it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI think it can read my mind\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tPerfect\\t1\\r\\n5\\t16-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"Love my spot!

Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t15-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\t\"Works great I love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t15-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\tGift for husband.  Great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t15-Jul-18\\tWhite  Spot\\tI had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t15-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I\\'m now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn\\'t.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t15-Jul-18\\tBlack  Spot\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x91. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love love love love it!

Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we\\'ll see what happens when we hand them out.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t31-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove listening to music.

No video services available except Amazon Video.  No Netflix or YouTube.

You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it\\t0\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tNo you tube wouldn\\'t have bought it if I known that\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tNeeds to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix. But it has good sound\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tWe love our Echo Show!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I love this device. I upgraded from the Echo Spot. I just wish I could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what I was used to in the echo spot. Also, there is better sound quality on this device.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Love this thing.. Best toy I\\'ve bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"This thing is a lot cooler than I thought it would be.  I mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but I also love that I can see into the camera while I\\'m at work.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tWe love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tWorks well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device. It\\'s just so convenient that I highly reccomend it to anyone who have the disposable income.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Love, love, LOVE!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove all my Echo products. I like the video phone feature on this. Can check in on our cat when on vacation.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI\\'ve only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it\\'s supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it\\'s too bad bc it\\'s like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it\\'s not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tVery excited to see what it can do\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating \"\"things to try\"\" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t \\t0\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Don\\'t waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I\\'ve worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn\\'t add much.  I can\\'t see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn\\'t, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I\\'m surprised Amazon didn\\'t make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love it. It does everything.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I\\'m loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it\\'s a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World\\'s Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.

Great sound.  Love the shopping list\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don\\'t want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tWe held off purchasing an Echo but couldn\\'t resist during Prime Days.

Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show\\'s capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won\\'t. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tIt\\'s a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.

It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.

In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGreat in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.  I plan to add more speakers in the future.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tSo far so good.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows.

I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought \"\"this is a cute novelty,  but I\\'ll probably never use it\"\". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"So far I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much it can do that I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clive\\xe2\\x80\\x9dversion is used, not the original version.  If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to pay for Prime Music...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I like everything, about this ! Im still learning how to use it!\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It\\'s like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn\\'t work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tReally easy to use\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tIt\\'s great sound and video quality\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe way the music sounds is poor quality\\t0\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It does everything the Echo does, and more. Although I haven\\'t and probably won\\'t use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won\\'t. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove my echo show!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI enjoy this thing.

Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tDoesn\\'t always respond to the wake word. This is my 3rd echo product and I have to say I am A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGood product.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tIt f****** sucks\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tLove being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever. All in all, definitely worth the purchase.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tAs you can see Echo Show is in kitchen.

My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn\\'t have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven\\'t thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven\\'t figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son\\'s dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don\\'t have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free.

Only thing it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s missing is youtube.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\teasy to use.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"I bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like I thought it would. It doesn\\'t alert us when someone is at the door. Also, I can\\'t talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupdated the firmware\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting really frustrated with the glitching.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tSuper fun !! I ty is what I was expecting\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tI love this so much!! Alexa is even better when she can show you things!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I\\'ve had an Alexa Dot for some time but I\\'m really enjoying the Alexa Show. It\\'s great to have a visual whether it\\'s a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I\\'m not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one\\'s watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven\\'t had it long enough to try everything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tGot this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don\\'t need to go see who at my door anymore while I\\'m gaming.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tEasy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that\\'s an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"quite nice...clear, great sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tEcho Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I love Alexa and when I had the chance to add Show to my home... I jumped at it.  But... I\\'m a member and my Show doesn\\'t know I paid for the extras with my Echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  If I am supposed to pay more for having Show added to my home, then I\\'m afraid to ask &#34;What\\'s the point?&#34;\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tPurchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tEcho Show is my personal assistant! Awesome!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tReally like the show me feature. I also like video calls with others.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn\\'t beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It\\'s perfect and getting better all the time.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe ase of participating with Echo\\t1\\r\\n3\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn\\'t do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove it!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLOVE!! i still haven\\'t figured out all the best things we can do with it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What\\'s not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis product is amazing!

I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThese things are great!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tbought two of these.

I am still learning everything it can do.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing... also time, notifications, news, etc!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Alexa takes some getting used to, but the picture quality is great, the touch screen is very responsive and smooth. Speakers are better than expected as wellFour stars out of five\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"I like the option for white, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features. I highly recommend it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThe ease of set up and overall functionality makes this Echo show worth every penny.  I especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that I use as personalized reminders.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love it!  I wanted it primarily for the kitchen.  In addition to other common services I wanted it to use ALLRecipes and Cook\\'s Illustrated recipes\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"Easy to use. Great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do....\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tI love being able to see information that Alexa gives.  When notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is. You can use the Echo screen to pull up details of your orders. You can use the Alexa skill to make calls from uhyour Echo.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\tGreat sound and video!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"really like it,\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Show\\t\"Love my Echo Show!!

And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way.

A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tLove it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\t\"It seems a little less intuitive then the regular Echo Plus. It\\'s also a little harder for it to pick up what you\\'re saying.  When combined with the other four we have in the household, having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones, so we had to rename this one.  Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Show\\tThis is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.

Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"It was an excellent purchase.

The unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with TV or music playing.I did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. Fidelity is very good for the size.My only regret is that I would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"We went to a Best Buy with the intention of buying Alexa products, instead were talked into the Google Home products.

After days of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9coops, something went wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up!

The included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly. I very much enjoy this product and recommend it.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tNot that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tTo have ability to play Amazon Music outside for patio gatherings. I also used blue tooth to connect Echo Plus via Alexa App on my tablet to an external speaker when/if the party extends into the yard. I have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWe got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn\\'t feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I love every aspect of the Echo Plus, I wanted it for my office.

I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I\\'d like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tVery satisfied with the purchase.

A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tPretty cool.

It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say \"\"Hey Alexa\"\". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Amazon Music is great. Love the ability to create my only playlists.

I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn\\'t know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren\\'t compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don\\'t want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I\\'ll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn\\'t operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn\\'t work.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThis Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I\\'m in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub\\'s, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven\\'t even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I\\'ve already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn\\'t even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn\\'t know it was a hub. But also because I didn\\'t really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you\\'re looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost\\'s the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\'m so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend\\'s home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven\\'t been able to listen to my CD\\'s for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it\\'s not an issue any longer.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"After we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with Echo Plus\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t29-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI Love it !!

It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up too close or to far the echo doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work.

I love it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tMy first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tIs great having a new friend\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tCoop product many uses including smart devices throughout the home\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tBetter than expected!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Wonderful, still learning how to use.

Very happy with the purchase.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove it!!!\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tFirst time using Alexa and so far I love it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tReally cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been waiting for Prime Day to purchase an Echo Plus and now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m enjoying learning what Alexa can do. With a new Sonos One and an Echo Dot, I have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. Love it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I haven\\'t had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t28-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found...\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t28-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it\\'s mostly YOUTUBE\\'s FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAwesome!! Loving Alexa\\t1\\r\\n1\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tno habla espanol\\t0\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove the music the stories\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tIt is fantastic.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLike it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond or you forget the correct command.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa, turn on the living room lights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Oops I mean \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa turn on the family room lights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tno it is broke and I can\\'t get help fixing or replacing it\\t0\\r\\n2\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tsounds great have not used the hub yet\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tSound is better\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tIt is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you\\'re far from it is simply just amazing.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAlthough I haven\\'t taken advantage of many of the Echo\\'s features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven\\'t said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t27-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWe have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t27-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tTerrible. Stopped working after one day.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tNice toy to have around!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not around,,,,,no Spanish!\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove all the cool thing I can do!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLike it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn\\'t realize and also wasn\\'t fully communicated to me, is that you can\\'t use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I\\'m only disappointed with the hub\\'s functionalities.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tStill needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don\\'t need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love my echo plus. I use it with my Spotify account, to find my phone, make phone calls,  turn our lights off and on, much more. Most importantly it reads story to my children.  They love it and that makes me happy.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tExcellent why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I think it is in the beginning I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tI love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tVery easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn\\'t connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWell behaved device that i enjoy using.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasy setup and sound quality.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI really love the hub feature\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tWhat a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tLove this!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tUse way more often than we used our Google Home.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Nice add on to a home.What I don\\'t like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won\\'t give you much info of sport teams other than American.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I\\'m no audiophile by any means so maybe it\\'s that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven\\'t had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip\\'s Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I\\'m glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tThe alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWorks as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That\\'s great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Great , love it.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\twish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tDoesn\\'t seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tA+\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tWorked great. The built in hub works great.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tIt knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that\\'s available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEase of use and many tasks it will perform\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it\\'s fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tNothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tThe Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tArrived right on time and works as expected\\t1\\r\\n4\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tIt\\'s like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home\\t1\\r\\n1\\t26-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights\\t1\\r\\n1\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tIt was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!\\t0\\r\\n3\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAwesome!\\t1\\r\\n1\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tHaven\\'t had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it\\'s way back to Amazon\\t0\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see what they come up with next.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove it.

I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love my echo plus!!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"How can you not like the Echo Plus.

However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t25-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love my Echo Plus and have cousins from Italy here visiting and they love it.

It\\'s been nothing but annoying.  The hub can\\'t be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can\\'t even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn\\'t support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn\\'t do many functions that a dedicated one will, what\\'s the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn\\'t.  I found that rather interesting.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t24-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n2\\t24-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tThe Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would.

I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\'m sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won\\'t get to try this one.

I\\'m not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tSo far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.

My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don\\'t need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t23-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t \\t1\\r\\n4\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees\\t1\\r\\n5\\t22-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tItem as described and delivered on time.  Thank you\\t1\\r\\n4\\t22-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tI bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tProduct does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective\\t0\\r\\n5\\t22-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tExactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tEasy to install\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn\\'t a huge stereo with settings but it doesn\\'t sound bad at all. Definitely doesn\\'t take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a sad fact. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll play pandora and Spotify but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn\\'t work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn\\'t the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn\\'t locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can\\'t get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I\\'m done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tGot this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tvery nice and its does not take up space\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\'m an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I\\'ve always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it\\'s got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\treceived the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t21-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work, the timer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t21-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tLove it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tSounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don\\'t really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don\\'t think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV\\'s and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won\\'t even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What\\'s the point of having a hub that doesn\\'t support half the devices out there?  DON\\'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won\\'t work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I love it, in my living room\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tAbsolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.\"\\t0\\r\\n2\\t20-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I\\'d understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn\\'t sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I was suppose to get the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xb3 of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many \\xe2\\x80\\x9c free\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI bought this for myself and i didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall.

The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It\\'s no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a \\'Group\\' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like \\'Thunderstorm sounds\\' and \\'Quote of the day\\' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it\\'s just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t20-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasy to Install. Very clear speaker.

I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x\\'s was enough, it shouldn\\'t be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won\\'t call me I\\'ll tell em to send the product back!\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t19-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"Pretty cool device.

I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much.

I would like to be able to talk to a device by name.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove the light bulb feature\\t1\\r\\n5\\t18-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\tThe Echo Plus works as expected but I never received the Philips Hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase.

It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t16-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Alexa is a decent speaker if that\\'s all you need.

I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I\\'m less than impressed.

The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing.

Thank you !\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tIt\\'s louder than the dot and it\\'s got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tEasy set up\\t1\\r\\n4\\t3-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It\\'s woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it\\'s usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we\\'ve had entertaining conversations with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t3-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tWORKS GREAT\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tVery happy\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove this device\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tI really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus. Just purchasing the plus I have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. I use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and I really like it. The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tLove it!!! Convenient. Responsive. Learns voices within the household. Best assistant so far!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t2-Jul-18\\tWhite  Plus\\t\"I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I\\'m always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they\\'re much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t1-Jul-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon\\'t fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack  Plus\\tamazing product with amazing sound!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jun-18\\tBlack  Plus\\t\"I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don\\'t have to worry about putting a CD, in to play.

Don\\'t miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn\\'t been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I\\'ll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can\\'t really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it\\'s unplugged. Haven\\'t tried it yet, although I don\\'t think it\\'ll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I\\'m using right now. So far I\\'m loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tEverything\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tLove this!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tReally enjoying my firestick can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tGood\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tEasy to set up and use.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tWooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tPerfect\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tConfiguration: Fire TV Stick\\tVery easy to use!

I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology.

I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It\\'s very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

SHE ROCKS!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall size works great in our sunroom.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn\\'t help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\"\\t0\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I\\'ve only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it.

I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this.

It\\'s a great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"What can I say. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.

She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts.

You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tlove it...just like the other 4 I own.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"Great price.

Haha\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tJust got my third one. Love them\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe ease in installing\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de m\\xc3\\xbaltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,informaci\\xc3\\xb3n de cualquier estudio que est\\xc3\\xa9s realizando atr\\xc3\\xa1s vez del internet.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don\\'t like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it\\'s an ok item.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the echo dot it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amaxing!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what\\'s new.  The one thing I don\\'t like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Just like it\\'s big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does everything  the big guy does\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat product - understands my accent!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it... can\\'t stop using it..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tReally like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tCool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt is s great tool helping with information.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tUsed twice not working!!!!!!!\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAwesome piece of technology that has simplified my life.

Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it\\'s not awkward, and it doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom.

And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSecond dot.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSon loves it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love how compact it is.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.

But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAlexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn\\'t work.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tSet up is so easy.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI\\'m amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don\\'t keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I\\'m finding more and more uses for this all the time.

The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.

It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.

I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes.

The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I\\'d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall convenient and dependable.

I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tthis is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy to set up and does everything it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poster.

Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything.

Not to tech savvy so, I\\'m still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEcho Dot responds to us when we aren\\'t even talking to it. I\\'ve unplugged it. It feels like it\\'s &#34;spying&#34; on us.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tNOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won\\'t regret this at all!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tPerfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tAlexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI\\'m addicted to this thing.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSo far all.i can say is I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ...

Great and easily fits in my decor of my home\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I\\'m obsessed with Alexa.

You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tSuper easy to hook up and program.

It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot more calmer and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a must have!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it.

After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall size works great in our sunroom.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn\\'t help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.

Definitely worth the money.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tIt plays music that I request.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI didn\\'t like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLuv it.  It\\'s a great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"What can I say. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat product\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more.

I\\'m a little behind the times I\\'ve never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It\\'s pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I\\'m not sure why. I\\'m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it\\'s perfect I don\\'t have any problems with the speaker.

So awesome how it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connects all my rooms. But like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume.

Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tJust got my third one.

So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don\\'t like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it\\'s an ok item.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the echo dot it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amaxing!!!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what\\'s new.  The one thing I don\\'t like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Just like it\\'s big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does everything  the big guy does\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat product - understands my accent!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it... can\\'t stop using it..\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tReally like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tCool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt is s great tool helping with information.\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tUsed twice not working!!!!!!!\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAwesome piece of technology that has simplified my life.

Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.\"\\t0\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it\\'s not awkward, and it doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker.

Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking.

I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\"\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t \\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I\\'m asking for.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tHANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it\\'s been a very frustrating experience.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tTotally gets out sense of humour\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWe put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'ll keep it or not!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tBetter sound.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I\\'d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\"\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSmall convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tAlexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x82 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tsmall footprint.  nice clarity.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tEasy set up\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it\\'s a great value\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn\\'t work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tthis is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEasy to set up and does everything it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"A great product for the price, works well!!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tPerfect for a home office\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWeak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it\\'s lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt does what it\\'s suppose to do great product.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove the dot\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tGreat item.  I\\'m so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I\\'m still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tLove having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I\\'m still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\"\\t1\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEcho Dot responds to us when we aren\\'t even talking to it. I\\'ve unplugged it. It feels like it\\'s &#34;spying&#34; on us.\\t0\\r\\n1\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tNOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(\\t0\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won\\'t regret this at all!\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tPerfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tAlexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tLove it!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI\\'m addicted to this thing.\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSo far all.i can say is I love it\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tGreat to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I\\'m obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????\"\\t1\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tWorks well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tWe have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tSuper easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great for my news updates too!\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tIt works just like my other Dots.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tSet up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.\\t1\\r\\n2\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tThe only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.\\t0\\r\\n3\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\t\"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.\"\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"Too soon, I\\'m still learning what I can do with it.\"\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tEnjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tI love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\tWorks great!\\t1\\r\\n4\\t30-Jul-18\\tWhite  Dot\\tI like almost everything\\t1\\r\\n5\\t30-Jul-18\\tBlack  Dot\\t\"AMAZING.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a day that goes by without music in our home.
